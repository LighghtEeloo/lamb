# lamb
programming language concept toy. in ocaml.
built for fun and not destroying human race.

## build && exec
you need `dune`.
to debug, `dune exec ./lamb.exe < utlc/test.lc`

## language set
currently implemented:
- utlc: each expr is in one of the following terms ending with `;` 
  1. `x` for var
  2. `\x.expr` for lambda terms
  3. `expr expr` for function applications

more will be implemented.

## roadmap
utlc > stlc > system-t > system-f > system-pcf > system-fpc > ?

## why not build feature x in y minutes
concept snacks aren't free. and i'm true veg. as said, built only for fun.

## your statics / dynamics is ill
so sad. hit me with whatever you like and i'll:
1. either fix it when available
2. or hit you back
